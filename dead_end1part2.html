    <h1>You Stumble Towards the Door</h1>
    <p class = "sfx"><em>drip drip</em></p>
    <p>Something is wrong. You've been hearing that dripping noise for a while now.</p>
    <p>Your legs feel heavy before they give out and your head slams against the door. You can't make sense of what's going on anymore.</p>
    <p>You look down at your feet. There's a pool of blood there.</p>
    <p>Blood? You wonder what happened as your vision darkens.</p>

    <h1>Dead End</h1>
    <p><em>Was it really a good idea to check the closet?</em></p>
