    <h1>You Walk to the Door</h1>
    <p>You put your hand around the doorknob and twist...</p>
    <p>Nothing happens. A horrible chill goes down your spine.</p>
    <p>You suddenly feel as if something is watching you.</p>
    <p>Heart pounding, you turn around and look behind you. There's something there.</p>

    <p>That thing cannot be good. You desperately twist the knob of the door but it does not open.</p>
    <p>The figure approaches and you close your eyes in fear.</p>
    <p>Nothing happens.</p>
    <p class = "sfx"><em>drip drip</em></p>
    <p>You sigh in relief and try the door knob again. It's unlocked.</p>
