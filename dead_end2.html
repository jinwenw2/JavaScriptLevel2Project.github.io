    <h1>You Approach the Door with Growling Inside</h1>
    <p>You approach the door as the growling grows silent. You twist the door knob but it doesn't open. It's locked.</p>
    <p>Thinking it was nothing you turn around to leave.</p>
    <p class = "sfx"><em>Shink!</em></p>
    <p>You look down at your feet. Blood is pouring down from your neck.</p>
    <p>Blood? You wonder what happened as your vision darkens.</p>
    <br>
    <h1>Dead End</h1>
    <p><em>Growling is a sign for danger.</em></p>
