    <h1>You Find Yourself in the Living Room</h1>
    <p>The living room has obviously seen better days.</p>
    <p>There's a potted plant nearby and the windows are boarded up. No escape through them.</p>
    <p>It has gotten a lot colder.</p>

    <p>You walk across the living room and stand next to the plant before you notice something.</p>
    <p><b>The front door is to the left!</b></p>
    <p><b>There's an opening to what looks like the kitchen to the right.</b></p>
