    <h1>You Slam Yourself Against the Window</h1>
    <p class = "sfx"><em>Crack!</em></p>
    <p>Cracks form along the window. Just once more should be enough.</p>
    <p>With great effort, you slam into the window again.</p>
    <p class = "sfx"><em>Crash!</em></p>
    <p>Your vision darkens and you hurtle downwards.</p>
    <p class = "sfx"><em>Snap!</em></p>
    <p>Something is wrong. You can't feel your lower body.</p>
    <p>Before you pass out, you see a giant mass plow through the wall and fall down right towards you.</p>
    <br>
    <h1>Dead End</h1>
    <p><em>Running may not have been the best idea. You also do not know how far up the window was from the ground.</em></p>
