    <h1>You Twist the Doorknob of the Door the Left</h1>
    <p>It's unlocked.</p>
    <p>As you open the door and peer into the room, a horrible chill goes down your spine.</p>
    <p>You a dozen pairs of glowing red eyes in the darkness.</p>
    <p class = "sfx"><em>Chitter! Chitter!</em></p>
    <p>You gasp and back away slowly but it's too late.</p>
    <p>A loud screech is heard before you are quickly buried under a pile of teeth that tear you to pieces.</p>

    <h1>Dead End</h1>
