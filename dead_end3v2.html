    <h1>You Dash Down the Stairs</h1>
    <p class = "sfx"><em>Creak!</em></p>
    <p>The stairs are shaking.</p>
    <p>They cannot sustain your entire weight while running for long.</p>
    <p class = "sfx"><em>Creak! Creak!</em></p>
    <p>You run with all your might but it is no use.</p>
    <p class = "sfx"><em>Snap! Crash!</em></p>
    <p>The stairs give and you fall with them.</p>
    <p>Crushed under a pile of debris, you hear a crash from the wall and glass shattering. A loud boom is heard from the outside.</p>
    <p>You start losing feeling in your body. You realize the debris must have crushed it as your vision darkens.</p>

    <h1>Dead End</h1>
    <p><em>Running may not have been the best idea. The stairs cannot sustain your weight while running.</em></p>
