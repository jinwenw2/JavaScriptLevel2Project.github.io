    <p>It's dark but there's a lamp at the end of the hallway.</p>
    <p>You feel a bit tired. It must be the cold.</p>
    <p>You can barely make out large claw marks on the walls before you see the outline of 3 doors at the end of the hallway.</p>

    <p>You stumble towards the 3 doors at the end of the hallway. One of them is in front of you, the other is to the left, while the last one is to the right.</p>

    <p><b>You are too tired to make sense of what is going on behind the doors.</b></p>
