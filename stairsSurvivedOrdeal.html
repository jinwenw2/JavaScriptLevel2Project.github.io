    <h1>You Head Back to the Stairs</h1>
    <p>There's a large whole where the windows once were.</p>
    <p>A mist still surrounds outside but you smell a stench coming from below.</p>
    <p>That thing from earlier must've fallen off and died. Good thing you didn't try to jump out from the window.</p>
