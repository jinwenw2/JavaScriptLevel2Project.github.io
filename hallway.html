    <h1>You Open the Door and Step Into a Hallway</h1>
    <p>You shut the door behind you and hear a click. It's locked.</p>
    <p class = "sfx"><em>SLAM!</em></p>
    <p class = "sfx"><em>THUMP! THUMP! THUMP!</em></p>
    <p>Something is pounding on the door you just came in from. Maybe it was a good thing you left.</p>
    <p>You wouldn't want to go back in now anyways.</p>

    <p>It's dark but there's a lamp at the end of the hallway.</p>
    <p>You can barely make out large claw marks on the walls before you see the outline of 3 doors at the end of the hallway.</p> 
    <p>You walk down the hallway and see 3 doors. One of them is in front of you, the other is to the left, while the last one is to the right.</p>
    <p><b>You can hear a creaking and whistling noise from the door in front of you.</b></p>
    <p><b>Nothing can be heard from the door to the left.</b></p>
    <p><b>You hear a growling noise from the door to the right.</b></p>    
    <p>Surely, one of them must lead to the exit, right?</p>
