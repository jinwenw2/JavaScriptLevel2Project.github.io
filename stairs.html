    <h1>You See Some Stairs in Front of You and a Hallway to the Left</h1>
    <p>There's a window with a crack in it to your left and you feel a breeze blowing in. There's no exit through there.</p>
    <p>You peer out the window and sigh. There's a mist surrounding the house and you cannot tell how far up you are.</p>
    <p>Shattering the window and chancing a jump is not a good idea.</p>

    <p><b>You hear creaking coming from below you. There may be something at the bottom of the stairs.</b></p>
    <p><b>The hallway to your left is dark except for a lamp next to a wardrobe. You can hear nothing from the hallway.</b></p>
